# Krunker Fluxon CSS
> A css built specifically for simplicity, consistency, versatility and menu clutter removal.
> 
This is the most average CSS you can ever think of. It was built as a motivational project during boredom, with goal of keeping it simple, cozy, and look competitive to other CSS.

## **This CSS Features:**
- A nice retouch to UI
  - A dark and slick UI makes it look really nice to the eyes.
- De-cluttered menu
  - No more bloated to oblivion UI. Everything that's important is kept. If you feel like something's you commonly use is missing, inform me!
- Smaller elements
  - Krunker been recently scaling up UI elements. This CSS makes UI elements smaller and more usable for space economy.
- Documented Style Sheet
  - The worst enemy when it comes to modifying other's CSS is organization of everything. The CSS is organised like a shelf and has identation and commentary that explains most stuff.
- Versatility
  - The CSS Contains `:root` code block that has many things to configure. Everyone may find their own configuration.
- Resolution support
  - *"if ur css depends on resolution you did it wrong" ~LukeTheDuke#7313.* Despite FHD resolution (1080p) being most commonly used, there are players and users who don't use FHD monitors. This CSS doesn't have any potential problems with resolutions and can be easily used on most *(if not, all)* monitors.
- UI Scale?
  - Recommended UI Scale is <0.8. Anything above that *may* cause UI Overlapping.
