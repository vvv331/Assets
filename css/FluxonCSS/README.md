This is the most average CSS you can ever think of. It was built as a motivational project during boredom, with goal of keeping it simple and cozy.

**This CSS Features:**
- A nice retouch to UI.
  - A dark and slick UI makes it look really nice to the eyes.
- De-cluttered menu
  - No more hundreds of UI's slapped straight into your face! Everything you need is kept for playability and usability sake.
- Smaller elements
  - Krunker been recently scaling up UI elements. This CSS makes UI elements smaller and more usable for space economy.
- Documented Style Sheet
  - I want people to understand what block does what. It is documented with identations and comments, making it easier to navigate.
- Versatility
  - The CSS Contains `:root` code block that has many things to configure. Everyone will find their own configuration!
- Resolution support
  - *"if ur css depends on resolution you did it wrong" ~LukeTheDuke#7313.* I want this CSS to be usable with all resolutions. While 1920x1080 is most commonly used, some people have either 4K monitors or lower resolution so lets not forget them.
